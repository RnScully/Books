I jokingly call book readers saps because they heavily over-rate books in the high ratings range, instead of seeming to have a scale that rates books they've read compared against one another, in a way that one would expect would create a uniform ranking. This makes choosing a book based on ratings much more challenging than choosing a resturant by rating, where a 3* resturant can be considered a middle of the road resturant...a middle of the road book seems to be mid 4 ranking. 

The project would be, then, to correct for this lean toward a human love of books and de-rank books into a uniform distribution. 

this repository includes a system for scraping goodreads for user ratings, cleaning that data, and adjusting a rating score.
